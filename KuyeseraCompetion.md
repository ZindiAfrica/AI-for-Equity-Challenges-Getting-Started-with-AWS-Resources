## Description

In March 2023, Cyclone Freddy caused devastating floods in Blantyre, Malawi, leaving destruction in its wake. Vulnerabilities such as inadequate drainage, deforestation, and unregulated urban sprawl exacerbated the disaster's effects, particularly in communities like Chilobwe on Soche Mountain. Societal inequalities deepened the crisis, with women, pregnant women, and young girls facing significant recovery challenges, including loss of shelter, limited healthcare access, and prolonged displacement.

Your mission is to develop a machine learning model to identify house locations and assess damage levels caused by Cyclone Freddy.

- **Dataset**: Training on the xBD dataset and testing on a hand-labeled dataset from Kuyesera AI Lab.
- **Challenge Complexity**: Real-world post-disaster challenges are reflected in the 6-month gap between pre- and post-disaster imagery.

Data is sourced from the **Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)**, Amazonâ€™s tech-for-good program supporting climate-related research. This challenge is one of two winning projects of the **AI For Equity Challenge**, in partnership with IRCAI and AWS.

### Supporting Partners

- **AWS**: World-leading cloud technologies for sustainability-related research.
- **IRCAI**: Focused on AI solutions for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
- **Kuyesera AI Lab**: AI research at Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences.

## Evaluation

The competition's evaluation metric is **Mean Absolute Error**.  
Submission files must include two columns: `id` and `target`.

Each image is classified into four categories:

1. Destroyed
2. Major Damage
3. Minor Damage
4. No Damage

Example submission format:

| id                                     | target |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ |
| malawi-cyclone_00000001_X_destroyed    | 0      |
| malawi-cyclone_00000001_X_major_damage | 1      |
| malawi-cyclone_00000001_X_minor_damage | 0      |
| malawi-cyclone_00000001_X_no_damage    | 5      |
