# Guide to Solving the SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge

This guide will help you develop a machine learning model to predict waterborne disease outbreaks in Tanzania using AWS SageMaker.

## Overview

The challenge involves:
1. Predicting outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases
2. Using data from multiple sources (2019-2022 for training, 2023 for testing)
3. Working with health facility data, environmental factors, and infrastructure information
4. Creating monthly predictions per disease type and age group

## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing Your AWS Environment

1. Log into AWS using your provided credentials
2. Navigate to SageMaker Studio
3. Open a new notebook

### 2. Available Data Sources

The competition data is available in S3: `s3://sua-outsmarting-outbreaks-challenge-comp/`

Key datasets:
- Health facility records (2019-2022)
- Climate data
- Water source locations
- Toilet quality assessments
- Waste management site data

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

```python
import boto3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Access competition data
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
bucket = 'sua-outsmarting-outbreaks-challenge-comp'

# Load and merge datasets
def load_data():
    # Load health records
    health_data = pd.read_csv('s3://{bucket}/health_records.csv')
    
    # Load climate data
    climate_data = pd.read_csv('s3://{bucket}/climate_data.csv')
    
    # Load infrastructure data
    water_sources = pd.read_csv('s3://{bucket}/water_sources.csv')
    toilets = pd.read_csv('s3://{bucket}/toilets.csv')
    waste_sites = pd.read_csv('s3://{bucket}/waste_sites.csv')
    
    return health_data, climate_data, water_sources, toilets, waste_sites
```

### 4. Feature Engineering

Key features to consider:
1. Temporal patterns (seasonality, trends)
2. Spatial relationships
3. Environmental factors
4. Infrastructure quality metrics

```python
def create_features(df):
    # Add time-based features
    df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']).dt.month
    df['season'] = pd.cut(df['month'], bins=[0,3,6,9,12], labels=['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'])
    
    # Calculate infrastructure density
    df['water_sources_nearby'] = calculate_nearby_sources(df)
    df['toilet_quality_score'] = calculate_toilet_score(df)
    
    # Add climate indicators
    df['rainfall_ma'] = df['rainfall'].rolling(window=3).mean()
    df['temp_ma'] = df['temperature'].rolling(window=3).mean()
    
    return df
```

### 5. Model Development

Recommended approach:
1. Start with baseline models per disease type
2. Implement separate models for different age groups
3. Consider ensemble methods
4. Account for geographical variations

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import xgboost as xgb

def train_disease_model(features, target, disease_type):
    # Split data
    X_train = features[features['year'] < 2023]
    y_train = target[features['year'] < 2023]
    
    # Train model
    model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
        objective='reg:squarederror',
        n_estimators=100,
        max_depth=6
    )
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    return model
```

### 6. Validation Strategy

1. Use time-based cross-validation
2. Evaluate per disease/age group
3. Monitor for geographical bias
4. Check for seasonality effects

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

def validate_model(model, features, target):
    tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
    scores = []
    
    for train_idx, val_idx in tscv.split(features):
        X_train, X_val = features.iloc[train_idx], features.iloc[val_idx]
        y_train, y_val = target.iloc[train_idx], target.iloc[val_idx]
        
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        preds = model.predict(X_val)
        score = mean_absolute_error(y_val, preds)
        scores.append(score)
        
    return np.mean(scores)
```

## Best Practices

1. Handle missing data appropriately
2. Account for reporting delays
3. Consider population demographics
4. Validate against historical outbreaks
5. Document assumptions

## Common Challenges

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Missing facility reports
   - Inconsistent location data
   - Reporting delays

2. **Modeling Challenges**
   - Rare events prediction
   - Geographic variations
   - Seasonal patterns

3. **Infrastructure Considerations**
   - Changes in water sources
   - Facility upgrades
   - Population movement
